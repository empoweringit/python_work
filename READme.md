# Python Training Course

Thank you for partaking in this course and,

Welcome to the Python Training Course! I John Underwood and EmpoweringIT LLC crafted this to guide beginners to success with python programming. This course is designed to guide you through the fundamental to advanced concepts of Python programming, and beginner to advanced programs and even games. Whether you are just starting out or looking to polish your skills, this course offers structured content divided into progressive sections, each dedicated to a specific level of Python expertise.

## Course Overview

This Python course is structured into multiple files, each focusing on different elements of Python—from basic syntax and data structures to advanced concepts like decorators and context managers. Our aim is to provide a holistic learning experience that covers all aspects of Python programming.

### Style Guide (PEP 8):

1. **Indentation**:

   - Use four spaces per indentation level.
   - Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python’s implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets, and braces, or using a hanging indent. When using a hanging indent, there should be no arguments on the first line, and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.

2. **Line Length**:

   - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
   - For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.

3. **Blank Lines**:

   - Used to group parts of the program visually.
   - Strike the right balance; not to be excessive. For example, if you have 5 lines of code that build and another 3 lines that do something with the list, place one blank line, but not 3 or more.
   - Needed for readability and to separate function and class definitions and larger blocks of code inside functions.

4. **Tabs or Spaces**:

   - Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
   - Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
   - Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.

5. **Maximum Line Length**:

   - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
   - For docstrings and comments, the line length should be limited to 72 characters.

6. **Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator**:

   - Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code.

7. **Blank Lines**:

   - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
   - Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

8. **Imports**:

   - Imports should usually be on separate lines.
   - Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.

9. **Whitespace in Expressions and Statements**:
   - Avoid extraneous whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces, between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis, immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon.

## Principles of Coding

Our course is rooted in the core principles of coding, inspired by "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters. Here are some of the key tenets you'll find embodied in our tutorials:

- **Beautiful is better than ugly.**  
  Emphasizing code aesthetics, we believe in writing clean and organized code that is not only functional but also pleasing to read.

- **Simple is better than complex.**  
  We strive to simplify concepts and break down complex problems, making learning Python accessible and manageable.

- **Complex is better than complicated.**  
  While Python can handle complex tasks, we ensure that complexity doesn't become convoluted. Each topic is presented with clarity and precision.

- **Readability counts.**  
  One of the strongest pillars of Python — readability is paramount. We encourage writing code that speaks and can be understood by others effortlessly.

- **There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it.**  
  Python’s philosophy of having a single, obvious way to perform a task ensures that our teaching methods are straightforward and consistent.

- **Now is better than never.**  
  Procrastination is the enemy of learning. This course encourages active practice and immediate application of learned skills.
